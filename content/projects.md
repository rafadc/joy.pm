# Experiments

An inventory of projects over time. I started keeping track of this on early 2023.

## Evilmeow.com
*10/2022 - Active*

My small mastodon instance. I don't like the approach twitter is taking althoug I still have to use it to keep in touch with some people. Anyway I let my geekiness roam free here.

I may eventually open it to the public but it is something that won't happen anytime soon. I am reading a lot about content moderation and probably it is not my cup of tea at the moment. The risk outweights the benefit.

I don't have the production code in k8s since I made a dead cheap version to keep everything up and running keeping recurring cost under 20$ (for production alone).

Then the backups and monitoring are roaming free at my home. I am monitoring everything using Grafana and Prometheus and I am relatively happy with that part.

## Micropomo
*02/2024 - Active*

[Github](https://github.com/rafadc/micropomo)

I needed a small pomodoro timer and I did not like anyone that was already there so I built my own


# No longer active Experiments

## Software crafters Madrid
*12/2012 - 03/2023*

During 10 years I helped with the organization of a meetup in Madrid about software development.

This was a very interesting experience. I learnt a ton and hopefully gave something back to all peers.

## The library of joy.pm
*02/2022 - 11/2023*

This was a crazy experiment to track the books I am reading. It was awesome to build a small rust tool I could use often.

You can find the notes for this in [this blog post](https://joy.pm/post/2022-01-10-weird_software_joy_pm_library).

Actually I don't use this anymore because I use [bookwhyrm](https://bookwyrm.social/user/rafadc) and Obsidian far more.
