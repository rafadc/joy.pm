# Experiments

An inventory of projects over time. I started keeping track of this on early 2023.

## Evilmeow.com
*10/2022 - Active*

My small mastodon instance. I don't like the approach twitter is taking althoug I still have to use it to keep in touch with some people. Anyway I let my geekiness roam free here.

I may eventually open it to the public but it is something that won't happen anytime soon. I am reading a lot about content moderation and probably it is not my cup of tea at the moment. The risk outweights the benefit.

I don't have the production code in k8s since I made a dead cheap version to keep everything up and running keeping recurring cost under 10$ (for production alone).

Then the backups and monitoring are roaming free at my home. I am monitoring everything using Grafana and Prometheus and I am relatively happy with that part.

## Software crafters Madrid
*12/2012 - 03/2023*

During 10 years I helped with the organization of a meetup in Madrid about software development.

This was a very interesting experience. I learnt a ton and hopefully gave something back to all peers.
