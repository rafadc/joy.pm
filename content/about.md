# About me

Hi!

I am Rafa and I am a software developer based in Spain. This is my little space on the internet.

Why does this space exist?

I don't consider myself smarter than other people. The first user of this blog is me. Sorry, not sorry. Anyway this is an exercise of building in public. This is an exercise of writing thoughts aloud. Allow me to be wrong sometimes.
