## First examples

It is funny because I am using this chapter to learn that Ethereum has now checksummed addesses which have both uppercase and lowercase addesses

For exmaple:

0xca35b7d915458ef540ade6068dfe2f44e8fa733c

That is not a checksummed address and I cannot hardcode it. In the book the addresses are all without checksum yet so we cannot use them.

It is fun because I didn't find any online checksummer. I am building my own  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
