I will be shutting down hackers.surf Lemmy instance. I will be moving my account to lemmy.world. Don't get me wrong, anyway. Lemmy is a great project that deserves to be kept and iterated. Anyway it is still fundamentally different from Mastodon in the sense that hosting an instance as a mere user makes less sense. Unless you are hosting a community you lose a lot of the benefits of searching and I still find myself too often into other people instances rather than my own.

I will put more effort into evilmeow.com and probably will be thinking in opening it into the public with the extra headroom I get from this.

Still, the idea of having public facing social services is scary to me. The moderation part will be a challenge and I only have good will as a weapon.
