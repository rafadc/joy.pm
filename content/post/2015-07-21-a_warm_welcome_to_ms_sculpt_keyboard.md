I just moved to a new Microsoft Sculpt keyboard. I am more than happy with it. I wanted to move to a split keyboard for a long time but I never had the guts to try. Indeed I wanted to move to a Model 01 but this makes a good intermediate step.

This is the first Microsoft product that I buy that feels really beautiful. It is really nice to have it in your table.

The position of the hands is really comfortable although a bit odd because it makes your wrists to stay horizontal. It feels strange in the beginning but the position is super relaxed.

There is a small detail I also love and it is that the spacebar is broken into two. Probably this is a really small detail but if I press it with a thumb the other thumb is not affected.

The keyboard is not bluetooth but comes with a small USB 2.4Ghz adapter which may not be ideal but is nice enough.

I don’t like noisy keycaps and in this laptop they are really silent. The pulsation is a bit mushy but if you come from a Apple keyboard like me this will feel super fine.

I was able to customize it to my taste using Karabiner which is an awesome tool for OsX. Also it allowed me to do some small hacks.

## Remap CapsLock to control
Of course I do this to every new computer I get. This saves a lot of pinky emacs pain.

## Switch between Alt and Command
In the sculpt keyboard these two keys are reversed in relation to where they are in a regular mac keyboard.

## Use CTRL+IJKL for cursor

This is really awesome. I’m really enjoying this. Now I no longer have to move my hands to the arrow keys for moving the cursor. I find this also saner than Vim’s hjkl. I did this because in my opinion the cursor keys in the sculpt are really uncomfortable to reach and now I did this change also in my laptop’s integrated keyboard.

In conclusion, I’m super happy with my acquisition. This is a really nice addon to my setup. I’m looking forward to get really used to it and next year I will aim for a Model 01.
