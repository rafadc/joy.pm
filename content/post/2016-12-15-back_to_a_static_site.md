I left [Medium](http://medium.com) as a main host for my site. Don't get me wrong. It is a great platform. I cannot recommend it enough and for a non hosted solution I think it is the best you can get. This is one of those "it is not you, it is me" situations. I want to be back to regular blogging. Something more hand made. Something I can do from emacs. I am willing to sacrifice a bit more reach in exchange for a bit more of "my personal place".

<!--more-->

So I will point the main page of my site to my [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and that is it. It is pushed to [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/rafadc/joy.pm) where the CI publishes it. I finally used gitlab since looks like the integrated Ci will give me more freedom to try some nasty stuff.

(Anyway probably I will check the crossposting plugin so I will still post to medium)
